Name of the company : 3MTech
name of the app : 


Class:
- Name: Current_Balance
- Description: it shows the current balance, it can be always updated(the user can add the balance es:salary, but it can't remove,it must use the expense)
- Attributes:

Class : 
- Name of class : Item;
- description : For the things the user buy (The lord of the rings, banana, detergent, ...);
- Attributes : Price, name, date, tags (books, food, cleaning stuff, ...).



requirement : 
- Show the total amount of expenses.
- The user should be able to filter and select data in order to display only expenses having certain tags. Every items must have at least one tag (by default, the tag "none").
- Bar graphs that count the number of items registered in the app within the selected period. Frequency of the bar graph : could be selected (daily, weekly, monthly).


It would be cool to see the days, weeks, months (depending of the frequency selected) within the selected period, where the user spent the most, to make him aware of his consumption.


Should we let the user to select the currency ? If so, we have to instanciate different instances from the class Current_Balance. Each instance for a currency.

UI : UNO Platform. Expenses tracker, so we want it to work a browser, on a phone.

back end : ???

We decided to begin (draw) the front end first in order to make sure that we have the same vision of the project.

We won't use Uno Platform. Instead, we will use React and Node.js

Maxime : Mainly UI
Mouni : mainly back-end
